\
2. In the beginning I had a challenge to understand the data structure of the products and customers, and how to access it (when looking for unique items). It was rewarding to see how much faster the rest of the tasks were accomplished once I understood how that works. \

3. One Feature is the possibility to discount products. In the initial Toycity Project items were sold at a discount, and it frequently happens that items are discounted. \
\
As a second feature, I made it necessary to include to actual sales price for each transaction. With transaction.discount then calculating the discount at which the item was sold. \
